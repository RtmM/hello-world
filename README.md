# hello-world
Refreshing GitHub knowledge

Hi I'm Rory! I'm a software developer that primarily makes applications for users to manage microcontroller equipment, particularly interfacing with RDM operable devices. I'm looking to get involved in free and open source software to boost my skill set.

I usually develop with C#, but frequently use VB6 and PHP/Javascript at work, and used Python and Java during my Computational Biology masters degree.
